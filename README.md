# calculator
August 5th 2021

A web app calculator created using  HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the Odin Project curriculum

Final Thoughts:
As simple as I feel a calculator would function, the project was defintely harder than I expected. Setting up the HTML + CSS to create the calculator front-end was easy. I used CSS grid to layout all the buttons needed for a proper calculator.  

The most challenging part of the code was the back-end Javascript. I had a hard time figuring out what values to store or what functions would be needed. It was also hard wrapping my head around how to append numbers to the display block and simultaneously compute calculations while also checking certain conditions such as having only one operator at a time. I feel like I had a harder time laying out the foundations of this code than I did the other projects I did. However, I was eager to learn how to get this calculator to work so I did a lot of research on it and finally got it done. 

I am still not 100% comfortable with the code on this project but I hope in the future I will understand it easily.
